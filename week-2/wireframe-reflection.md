This is the wireframe for the blog ![wireframe blog](/san115/san115.github.io/wireframe-blog.jpg)


**What is a wireframe?**
A wireframe establishes torganizes the content to determine the layout of the Web page and the forms in which the user will operate the interface. Similar to a blueprint, it outlines how the page will be structured. It identifies and assigns the content to various elements, such as links, menu items, main/text, side bar items, footer, etc. It also shows the form in which the content will appear, as blocks of text, in a table format, as lists, or forms that require input, and so on. It also indicates visual and images that will appear, such as headers, logos,pictures, illustrations, etc. 

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
Creating wireframes allows the developers and designers to develop a plan to present the content and the overalll look and design of the site and helps to figure out the experience of the users. It defines the hierarchy of the elements, what will be highlighted or assigned to the sidebar. It provides a plan of action for creating prototypes. 


**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
While it is an important and necessary step, the process left me with more questions than answers. It could very well be be because this is my first attempt, not just with this step, but creating this kind of Web site. I realized that because it informs on the type of content and the form in which it will appear, making changes would have significant impact on the development and construction of the site, much like a change on a blueprint. So, it definately seems important to create one that workers are committed to. I, however, have feeling that I'll end up making changes, since I'm not sure that the current plan works.


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
My overall plan was to keep everything simple, so it didn't require many revises, and I stuck mostly to my initial ideas. Since I'm not sure that I like what I have, it seemed better to have less than more at the beginning. 


**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
Some of the questions were: which content would be the focus and which would be consigned to sidebar or menu items? how would I present the content? What kind of visual elements will I include? What items will appear as links? What will the users need to see? 


**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
Creating a Web site about myself, even if it's meant for professional purposes, is a foreign concept that I'm still trying to get used to. So, for me neither the words enjoy nor tedious is fitting description of this task. However, I've realized that wireframing is an important step in the process of developing a Web site. It can easily determine and influence not only how the site gets constructed but its outcome.
