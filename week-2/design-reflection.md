*1.	What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?*
The six phases of Web design are:
* Information gathering: gather information to identify the purpose of the site—will it provide information or service, the goals for having the site—what will the site help you to do, and the target audience—who do you want to use the site?
* Planning: use the information gathered to create a site map, which organizes the main and subtopics in an easy-to-use navigational system. Also, identify the technologies that will be used for the site.
* Design: work with designers to figure out the look and feel of the site, based on the target audience, and develop prototype designs and logos. Need to make sure that the design elements reflect the intent of the content.
* Development: create the Web site by incorporating the design elements. At this stage, the developer builds the home page and creates a shell, or a template, for the interior pages and makes changes to the site. This includes implementing technologies, such as CMS, forms, shopping carts, as well as writing valid HTML/CSS codes that meet the web standards.
* Testing and delivery: test the site and finalize details, such as installing plugins. Sites are tested for functionality and compatibility on different browsers. The web designer checks that all the codes for the site are valid and meet the current web development standards and the Web site files are uploaded to a server and run through to make sure that all the files have been uploaded correctly and the site operates properly.
*Maintenance: update information and implement changes as necessary and conduct site backups.

*2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?* 
The primary goal of the site is to be used as a professional Website to introduce myself to prospective employers. It will contain a portfolio and other information that will help the prospective employers to figure out whether I would be a good fit in their organization.

*3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?*This probably will be the most difficult to solve, since there a variety of approaches to consider. It would depend on figuring out exactly what I’m looking to do: would I seek work in same field that I’ve been working in, but as a developer? in an entirely different field? seek work solely as a developer regardless of the type of field? or perhaps consider what type of work I would not want to do? I don’t have the answer to this just yet.

*4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.*
The primary action of the visitors should be to explore the portfolio. Visitors would also be encouraged to check out other information to better gage whether I’d be a good fit for them.

*5.	What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?* 
The design of Web sites should focus on enhancing the quality of user experience, that the users should feel good about using the site. The goal of design should lead users to conclude that the Web site was easy and pleasant to use and that it has value.

*6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?*
The goal of user experience design is to help users have a pleasant experience using the site. It is a combination of aspects, such as usability and accessibility, that make using the site pleasant and efficient.

*7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?* 
All of the materials are new to me, so I didn’t find anything tedious.
