<!--
	- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? It was nerve-wrecking at first, but as we began to assemble the tags and add the content onto the Web page, checking to see that we have the right parts, the concepts that we learned from the readings and practice drills began to make more sense.

	- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? There is an abundance of materials on the Web, and I found that you need to look into a variety of sources, as each provides a slightly different take or approach or focuses on different topics. However, after reading few selections, the main concepts are presented in more or less the same manner, so even if I don't grasp everything, I'm able to understand the big, overarching concepts. With the details, it seems like that requires more on-hand experments to really get a hang of it.

	- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) I conferrred with my partner to check that we have all the necessary parts and that the syntax is for the tags are done properly. However, I skipped a crucial section in the lesson outline (checking the html text on HTML Validator tool), so had to go back to correct errors.

	- What seems good and bad about HTML? I haven't worked on it enough to really know. However, already it seems like one has to be really on top of the syntax to avoid hours of headache. The devil is in the details, as they say.

	- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? I noticed that my partner always inputs the initial and end tag. That seems like a good idea, so that you don't forget or have to trace your work to figure out which ones are missing the end tags.
