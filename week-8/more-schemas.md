Reflections:
What is a one-to-one database? It describes a relationship in which only one element in each table has a relationship that is specific to one another or relationship in which one thing can be defined by the other. For example, student id and student name. 
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created). One-to-one database might be useful to simplify a database by putting information that is only needed for specic purposes or settings on a separate table. This would avoid cluttering the database. 
What is a many-to-many database? Many-to-many relationships have many associations. For example, students have many classes, and classes have many students. Many-to-many database is connected by a joining table that asociates the two tables with foreign keys.
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created). Many-to-many database might be
useful for databases that go in details about a related subject or topic. The information in the related areas can, then be used to inform eachother.
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense? While the relationships make sense, it is less clear to figure out when to use or how to set up the relationships.
