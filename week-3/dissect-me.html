	      <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3> 
	      <p>Version control allows developers to make changes without risking harm or damage to the master, or the ideal, version. By working on copies of a master version, developers are freed from having to recreate the whole work, and instead can develop sections of the work.  It’s a good way to test out and experiment different methods without risking the integrity of the master or introducing errors. It also allows for multiple developers to work on a project at the same time.</p>
	        
	      <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3> 
	      <p>Git is a program that helps developers to keep track of changes, which is a key feature of version control. Developers create branches, or copies, of the master, which they use to make changes. By using copies, changes can be compared to the original, and they are recorded in a log, which shows the history of how a project has changed and evolved.</p>
	   
	      <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3> 
	      <p>GitHub is a repository for open source codes, which means that developers share their codes with other developers and the public. Having codes be open source is a way to not only share codes, but also allows for them to evolve and develop as other use and change them. And, because credit is given to the developer who writes the original code and to those who contribute to its development, it maintains copyright conventions.</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used <main>, <header>, and <section> tags in this challenge, since they help to demarcate the content into a hierarchy and help to indicate the structure of the page. Although this is page has a very simple structure, the <main> tag indicates the content included within is the main topic of the page. The content contained inside the <header> tag consists of the main headings for the Web page, while the content inside the <section> tags consists of texts that relate to the maing topic. Although not present in this page, the other tags that has been used often are also <nav> for displaying a collection of links and <aside> for content that are related topics, much like one would see in sidebars.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? The elements are laid out following the order of the content in which they appear in the html document. That is to say, from top to bottom of the html document.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
I learned to create snippits using Sublime, which are templates of html codes that you costomize. This would be useful for creating html files that require the same content structure, since the template files provide the basic codes needed. They are a type of shortcut and with the benefit of not having to worry about creating errors, such as missing part of tags or typos, that would be required if one were to type them for each file. One shortcut I noticed is that Sublime provides menu of html tags when I type open bracket and aletter. This shortcut is useful as it automatically provides the beginning and end tags at once.
