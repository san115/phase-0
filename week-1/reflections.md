## 1.1 Think About Time
I'm prone to procrastination, so setting small goals and developing tiny habits seem helpful. Doing things on a small scale would make the work more manageable and less intimidating. Also, the technique of establishing a habit before the mindset, a version of "fake it 'till you make it", could be useful, since half the battle of procrastination is overcoming the mental trap. Time boxing, which requires setting up specific time spans to complete tasks, probably would also be useful in phase 0. By setting specific amount of time, one needs to be focused and avoid distractions and getting bogged down. Time boxing and being mindful would also be useful tactics for collaborative projects, since it's  much harder to maintain focus and much easier to get distracted or bogged down in paired or group settings. I don't use any time management techniques. So, when I procrastinate, I usually have to sprint to make up for the lost time. The work turns into a bigger deal than it actually is, a mountain out of a molehill, the opposite effect of the small-scale techniques. For now, I'd like to try the techniques to deflect procrastination for solo projects. For collaborative work, if needed, I might suggest using the time boxing and other techniques that would help to maintain focus and avoiding distractions or getting bogged down.

## 1.2 The Command Line
**1a. What is a shell?**
A shell is program for Unix that takes in instructions, processes and translates them, and returns the output. For example, the shell processes the command lines that we use on Terminal (is this correct?).

**1b.What is "bash?"**
Bash is a type of Unix shell and a command language that accepts and provides text-based output. So, when we use command lines, we’re using bash. (is this correct?)

**2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**
There is a lot of information to get through, and, while the exercises were helpful, due to the amount of commands, it’ll take some time and practice to get used to using them. Also, there were a couple of exercises where the output on my Terminal was not matching up to the expected output, due to typos. So, I spent a lot of time going back to figure out what had gone wrong. Learning to input commands accurately may also be somewhat of a challenge.

**3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**
Yes, but it took a while to figure out why I was getting error messages--mainly from typos, but looking for them were sometimes time-consuming.

**4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**
The important commands are ones that let you navigate around and manipulate directories and files, create and remove files and directories (cd, pushd, popd, mkdir, touch, rm, rmdir). Also, the “grep” command and the use of * to conduct specific searches seem useful.

**5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**
-pwd: print working directory; shows the current directory the user is in

-ls: lists files in a directory

-mv: moves, or renames, files or directory

-cd: change to a different directory

-../ move up one level in the directory hierarchy

-touch: create an new/empty file

-mkdir: create a new directory

-less: displays the files

-rmdir: removes directory

-rm: removes a file

-help: in Mac "man", shows information about a command

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning
**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?**
**Create a new repo:**
1. Go to your github.com profile and click on the “+” at the top right-hand corner of the page, next to the avatar.
2. Select “New Repository” which will take you to a new repository page.
3. Under “Repository name”, type “phase-0”, click the “Public” option, and for “Add a license”, type “MIT License”
4. Click “Create repository” button.

**Fork a repo:**
1. Go to the repository page that you want to clone from and click on the fork logo at the top-right corner of the page.
2. When a screen pops out that asks for where to fork the repository, click on your repository.
3. A new repository page for your account will appear. The top-left of page should display fork logo, followed by [user name]/[name of repository forked from]

**Clone a repo:**
1. From Terminal, navigate to the directory you want to clone the contents of the repository using command lines.
2. Go to the repository page and copy the HTTPS clone URL, located on the right sidebar column.
3. From Terminal, type “git clone [URL]
4. To check that the contents were copied into the local drive, list the files.

**Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**
By forking a repository, it creates a copy of all the contents in the original source so there is no need to track files. Creating a new repository, however, would require the user to check to ensure the contents contain an exact copy. For example, correct version or amount of files.

**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**
From what I recall, I don’t remember struggling too much, since all I had to do for the most part was to just follow instructions, so I don’t think that I learned anything.
