## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository on GitHub, go to the new repository form page on GitHub. Create a name for the repository, using the user name: [username].github.io". Make sure the repository is set in "Publick" mode so the others can view the contents. Next, fill in the "Add a licence" section by typing "MIT license" and click on "Create repository" button. You should now see a new repository page on GitHun with the repository name ([username].github.io]). Now, you're ready to clone the repository to your computer.

From the new repository page, copy the HTTPS clone URL, on the sidebar at right of the page. Then, go to Teriminal and type and paste "git clone [URL link]". Check with "ls" command. There should now be a new directory  named [username].github.io.

Open source allows for sharing of codes for the public. Anyone can have access to  programs and use them for one's purposes by customizing or changing them. This seems to be a good way to share information with others and learn from each other. As well, it would be a good way to encourage codes to develope and evolve. Open source licensing is a good way to encourage info sharing, as the creator still holds rights, but contributors can also get credit for their input.

At this point, I still don't feel comfortable and often feel unsure of the git workflow. However, having gone through the process a few times has given me a little bit of confidence. I think I'm still waiting for that "ah ha" moment, although this might be more the matter of repetition and practice than having an insightful moment. For now, I'm trying to get used to the steps of the git workflow. One tip that got and have started using is to pay attention to the instructions that appear from "git status" , as it tells you what you need to do. For now, they are good clues to help me figure out where I am.
